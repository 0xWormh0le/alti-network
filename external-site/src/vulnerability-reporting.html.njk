			<p>Altitude Networks appreciates any reports of security concerns from members of the security community. Issues will be investigated promptly and we’ll maintain communications with the security reporter. At this time we do not have a financial bounty program; but we’d be happy to recognize your efforts and send a company shirt your way.</p>
